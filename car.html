                    If you live and commute within Davis, you don't need a car (I don't have one). That being said,
                    driving or using a
                    ride-share service offers more freedom and flexibility for traveling. If you own a car, you need
                    to learn about how parking works on campus. There are also different driving options available for
                    non-car owners.

            <p class="section-text">
                Unitrans is the bus service is managed by ASUCD, the UC Davis student body, and operated by students.
                They offer great coverage of the city and are a great way to commute to and from campus. There are bus
                terminals at both the Silo and Memorial Union on campus. The bus stops
                and schedules can be found on the <a class="info-link" href="https://unitrans.ucdavis.edu/">Unitrans</a>
                website.
                You can also use Google Maps to plan your route (it's usually pretty accurate). </p>
            <p class="section-text">Because Unitrans is
                funded by ASUCD, students can ride the bus for free. All you need to do is show the driver your student
                ID. If you are not a student,
                (put fares in table?) fare is currently $1.50 to ride the bus. You can also buy passes through
                the ZipPass mobile app or at the UC Davis store, 8.50 for ten rides, 34 for month, or 87 for the
                quarter, 245 for the annual pass.</p>

            <p class="section-text">
                I ride Unitrans often, especially in the winter when it is too cold or wet for me to bike. Most of the
                time, service is frequent and reliable. One of the few issues I have is that bus service is pretty
                sparse on the weekends. Also, because so many people rely on Unitrans, buses can get very packed and it
                can be an uncomfortable (albiet short) bus ride.

            <p class="section-text">YoloBus is a bus service for all of Yolo County. It has multiple stops in Davis,
                including the Memorial Union terminal. I often use Yolo Bus to visit
                Sacramento or to go to the airport. Just like Unitrans, YoloBus is free with your student ID so you can
                save a lot of money by using YoloBus to go to and from the airport instead of something like Uber,
                especially since ride share services will upcharge for airport fares.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Yolo County service is not bad, but it can be a little inconsistent. There have been
                a few times where I have had to wait a lot longer than I expected for the bus to arrive. I think YoloBus
                is a good way for non-car owners to visit Sacramento. My strategy is usually to bus to Sac then take an
                Uber back.</p>

            <p class="section-text">Safe Rides is a free rideshare service offered by the UC Davis Police Department. As
                the name implies, it is a way for you to safely get back home, even if it is night and the buses have
                stopped running.(list hours, wait times, how to book a safe ride, coverage).</p>
