                    If you live and commute within Davis, you don't need a car (I don't have one). That being said,
                    driving or using a
                    ride-share service offers more freedom and flexibility for traveling. If you own a car, you need
                    to learn about how parking works on campus. There are also different driving options available for
                    non-car owners.

        <div class="section" id="campus-parking">
            <h1 class="section-header">Parking on campus</h1>
            <p class="section-text">Parking on campus is paid most of the time. To pay for parking, you need to get the
                AMP Park app and register with your UC Davis email if you're a student. Each parking lot is assigned a
                specific zone that determines the rate. You can visit the <a class="info-link"
                    href="https://transportation.ucdavis.edu/types_and_rates#price">Transportation Services</a> website
                to get the
                full details and rates, but TLDR most of time people currently pay $4.50 a day for parking in a C zone.
                Paying for parking can be annoying, but DOTS (TAPS) is pretty strict with enforcing parking, so it is
                probably best to pay.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">If you have to be on campus every day, then parking can get pretty expensive, so I
                would encourage people to see if other transit options are viable for them. Also traffic can get pretty
                bad during rush hour and many parking lots and structures get full, making driving that much more
                annoying.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section" id="rideshare">
            <h1 class="section-header">Uber, Lyft and Rideshare Services</h1>
            <p class="section-text">You already know about these, so I'll be brief. Uber is convenient and widely
                available, but also really expensive. I think it's great if you're in a pinch or traveling with multiple
                people and can split the bill, but it's not really a day-to-day solution for commuting for most people.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text"></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="zip-car">
            <h1 class="section-header">Using ZipCar</h1>
            <p class="section-text">ZipCar is short-term car rental service. There are multiple ZipCar spots in the city
                where you can borrow a Zipcar for an hour to a day. <a
                    href="https://www.zipcar.com/universities/university-of-california-davis"
                    class="info-link">ZipCar</a> charges for a annual membership plus the hourly or daily rate for a
                car. They do seem to have discounted plan for students.</p>
            <p class="section-text">As the name implies, the point of ZipCar is quickly go somewhere and back. It's good
                if you need to quickly get something or run a few errands, but it can get really expensive if you are
                going somewhere and staying there for an extended period. ZipCar keeps charging you until you return the
                car to original spot where you borrowed it from. People who use ZipCar generally like it, but I think it
                is meant for a particular person who does not own a car, but wants/needs a car for short periods of
                time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="moober">
            <h1 class="section-header">Using Moober</h1>
            <p class="section-text">Moober is a carpool service created by AggieWorks, a UC Davis student organization.
                <a href="https://mooberdavis.com/" target="_blank" class="info-link">Moober</a> is for UC Davis students
                only and allows
                them to post or find rides with other students.
            </p>
            <p class=" section-text">Those who do not have a car can find students leaving or
                going back to Davis and can carpool with them. People who do drive can post their route on Moober
                for
                others to see. Non-car owners can pay less for their trip (prices vary but a trip from Davis to the
                bay
                area is usually around $15) than if they had taken Amtrack or Uber. Car owners can save money by
                splitting the cost of gas with others.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">Moober is still growing so there may not be a lot of rides posted, but it is a
                promising alternative to other long-distance travel methods.</p>
