                    Davis offers great public transportation methods in the form of Unitrans and YoloBus. These buses
                    offer
                    an inexpensive way to get around the city and county. I enjoy biking, but when it's pouring or over
                    100F
                    you can find me on the bus.

            <h1 class="section-header">Buying a bike</h1>
            <p class="section-text"> There are several options for buying new or used bikes. New bikes are obviously
                going to be higher quality and probably give you less problems generally speaking, however buying a used
                bike can save you lots of money and with a little bit of work they can usually ride good enough for
                day-to-day use.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Buying bike accessories can make your commute nicer and safer. In addition to
                necessities like a good lock and set of lights, having something like a basket makes it much more
                pleasant to ride a bike, in my opinion. Another popular accessory are fenders, which I personally do not
                use, but they can be very nice to have if you plan to bike a lot during the rainy season.</p>
            <h3 class="section-subheader">Bike Barn</h3>
            <p class="section-text">The Bike Barn is located right in the center of campus at the Silo. They are managed
                by ASUCD, the student government body at UC Davis, and they offer a variety of bike services and
                products. They sell both new and refurbished bikes. Additionally, they can do repairs or modifications
                to bikes and they sell bike accessories such as lights and locks. It should be noted that the Bike Barn
                tends to be more expensive than some of the other places here and there can be long wait times for
                repairs, but considering their location on campus
                they are a convenient, easy option.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subheader">Bike shops in Downtown Davis</h3>
            <p class="section-text">There are several bike shops in downtown Davis that offer bikes and services. Some
                of the most popular ones are the Davis Cyclery, Freewheeler, and Green Bicycle Depot. These shops all
                have very positive reviews and can be cheaper than going to the Bike Barn. </p>
            <p class="section-text"> Pretty much all the bike
                shops in Davis are high quality and you can't really go wrong with any of them, it just depends on what
                type of bike you are looking to buy. I would recommend going to multiple shops and discuss the type of
                bike you want with the mechanics there.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subheader">UC Davis Bike Online Auction</h3>
            <p class="section-text">The bike auction held by UC Davis Transportation Services (DOTS or TAPS) is a great
                way to get an affordable, used bike. Usually every month, DOTS will auction off bikes that have been
                abandoned on campus. Many of these are decrepit but there are serveral auctioned that are fully
                functional or just need a few tune ups.</p>
            <p class="section-text">The auction is held online on GovDeals where you can view images
                of the available bikes. If you are unsure about the quality of a bike, you can call the Bike Program,
                whom manage the auction, and you can schedule an appointment to view the bike in-person before you bid
                on it.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subheader">Things to Avoid</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Two things I would recommend avoiding when looking for a bike: getting a very
                cheaply made bike or getting an ultra-expensive bike. Bikes that can be bought from major retailers like
                Target or Walmart can be really inexpensive, but the trade-off is reliability and durability. These
                bikes will usually not last very long and may need a lot of repairs and work if you plan on using it for
                an extended period of time.</p>
            <p class="section-text">On the other side of the spectrum, I would also avoid buying bikes that are very
                expensive. These bikes may be really nice to ride, but they are highly vulnerable to bike theft. Theives
                like to target expensive bikes and even if you use a good lock it probably won't stop them.</p>

        <div class="section" id="yolo-bus">
            <h1 class="section-header">Using SPIN Bikes and Scooters</h1>
            <p class="section-text">Since 2023, Davis has partnered with SPIN to allow students and residents to rent an
                E-bike or E-scooter. SPIN bikes and scooters can be found throughout the campus and city, so they can be
                a convenient option for a short commute. </p>
            <p class="section-text">To use SPIN, you must download and use their app to access
                their bike/scooter fleet. Currently the cost of SPIN is $1 to unlock the vehicle, and $0.32 per minute
                of use. You stop getting charged once the vehicle has been locked. Make sure to lock your bike to a
                proper rack or spot and to not block any pathways.</p>
            <p class="section-text">SPIN can be great for a quick or last-minute trip, but if used every day then the
                costs can really add up. I personally would recommend just buying a bike or scooter than relying on
                SPIN. Also I have heard issues of SPIN bikes bing difficult to lock, which leads people being charged
                for minutes they are not using. Occasional connectivity and network issues can hamper SPIN's
                reliability.</p>

        <div class="section" id="best-practices">
            <h1 class="section-header">Keeping You and your Bike Safe</h1>
            <p class="section-text">Davis being a bike city means that infrastructure and people tend to be more leniant
                toward cyclists than other cities. However, accidents absolutely still happen and proper safety
                precautions should be taken. Additionally, the sheer volume of bikes here makes it a popular spot for
                bike theft, so it is important to keep your bike secure when you are not using it.</p>
            <h3 class="section-subheader">Safety Tips</h3>
            <p class="section-text">The main ways to stay safe are pretty simple: Follow traffic laws, wear a helment,
                and use front and rear lights if biking in the dark. With so many cyclists on campus, its pretty
                important to ride in a predictable manner and follow the rules of the road. It is very common for people
                to get involved in a collision because somone did not follow the right-of-way rules. If you do get in an
                accident, properly wearing a helment can greatly decrease the chance of serious injury. You should find
                and buy a helment that you don't mind wearing every day. Also, the Bike Barn on campus has a program
                that gives away free bike helmets to students.</p>
            <p class="section-text">You should also be using a front and rear light when you are biking in the dark.
                Davis does not have as much lighting as other cities, due to concerns of light pollution, so roads can
                get very dark. Lights ensure that you can see where you are going and that other vehicles can see you.
                The Bike Barn also has a program that gives lights away to students.</p>
            <h3 class="section-subheader">Keeping your Bike Secure</h3>
            <p class="section-text">You should always keep your bike locked when it is kept outside. The type of lock
                you use matters a lot. A high quality U-Lock or Chain lock will offer the best protection for your bike.
                In my opinion, Kryptonite makes good locks, specifically their New York U-Lock or any of their thick
                chain locks. These locks will be pretty expensive, but I think they are worth it if you have a nice
                bike. </p>
            <p class="section-text">I would also suggest pairing your lock with a cable to protect your rear wheel,
                because it is common for theives to just steal a wheel from a bike. I use my U-lock to lock my frame and
                front wheel to a bike rack, then use a cable to lock my rear wheel to the U-lock.</p>

        <div class="section" id="repairs">
            <h1 class="section-header">Repairing your Bike</h1>
            <p class="section-text">Bikes are great, but inevitably, like every other vehicle, they will fail on you for
                one reason or another. When a problem occurs, you can either pay a bike mechanic to fix your bike or you
                can do it yourself.</p>
            <h3 class="section-subheader">Bike Shops</h3>
            <p class="section-text">The simplest solution is to bring your bike to a bike shop and pay them to fix it.
                The Bike Barn or any of the the bike shops in the city can repair your bike. Like I mentioned earlier,
                Bike Barn will probably be more expensive and may take longer because they usually a backlog of repairs
                to deal with, but they are convenient if your bike is already on campus.</p>
            <p class="section-text">If the repair required is complex, then I would recommend getting a trained mechanic
                to fix your bike. However, if it is a simple problem, then I think you should try to fix your bike
                yourself.</p>
            <h3 class="section-subheader">DIY</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Simple problems like replacing a tube or chain can be done yourself. Even if you are
                not comfortable repairing a bike, there are a lot of good documents and videos online that can teach you
                how to do repairs. Buying replacement parts and doing your own repairs is a lot cheaper and will teach
                you more about bikes!</p>
