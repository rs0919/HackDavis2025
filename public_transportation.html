                    Davis offers great public transportation methods in the form of Unitrans and YoloBus. These buses
                    offer
                    an inexpensive way to get around the city and county. I enjoy biking, but when it's pouring or over
                    100F
                    you can find me on the bus.

            <h1 class="section-header">Keeping You and your Bike Safe</h1>
            <p class="section-text">Davis being a bike city means that infrastructure and people tend to be more leniant
                toward cyclists than other cities. However, accidents absolutely still happen and proper safety
                precautions should be taken. Additionally, the sheer volume of bikes here makes it a popular spot for
                bike theft, so it is important to keep your bike secure when you are not using it.</p>
            <h3 class="section-subheader">Safety Tips</h3>
            <p class="section-text">The main ways to stay safe are pretty simple: Follow traffic laws, wear a helment,
                and use front and rear lights if biking in the dark. With so many cyclists on campus, its pretty
                important to ride in a predictable manner and follow the rules of the road. It is very common for people
                to get involved in a collision because somone did not follow the right-of-way rules. If you do get in an
                accident, properly wearing a helment can greatly decrease the chance of serious injury. You should find
                and buy a helment that you don't mind wearing every day. Also, the Bike Barn on campus has a program
                that gives away free bike helmets to students.</p>
            <p class="section-text">You should also be using a front and rear light when you are biking in the dark.
                Davis does not have as much lighting as other cities, due to concerns of light pollution, so roads can
                get very dark. Lights ensure that you can see where you are going and that other vehicles can see you.
                The Bike Barn also has a program that gives lights away to students.</p>
            <h3 class="section-subheader">Keeping your Bike Secure</h3>
            <p class="section-text">You should always keep your bike locked when it is kept outside. The type of lock
                you use matters a lot. A high quality U-Lock or Chain lock will offer the best protection for your bike.
                In my opinion, Kryptonite makes good locks, specifically their New York U-Lock or any of their thick
                chain locks. These locks will be pretty expensive, but I think they are worth it if you have a nice
                bike. </p>
            <p class="section-text">I would also suggest pairing your lock with a cable to protect your rear wheel,
                because it is common for theives to just steal a wheel from a bike. I use my U-lock to lock my frame and
                front wheel to a bike rack, then use a cable to lock my rear wheel to the U-lock.</p>

            <h1 class="section-header">Repairing your Bike</h1>
            <p class="section-text">Bikes are great, but inevitably, like every other vehicle, they will fail on you for
                one reason or another. When a problem occurs, you can either pay a bike mechanic to fix your bike or you
                can do it yourself.</p>
            <h3 class="section-subheader">Bike Shops</h3>
            <p class="section-text">The simplest solution is to bring your bike to a bike shop and pay them to fix it.
                The Bike Barn or any of the the bike shops in the city can repair your bike. Like I mentioned earlier,
                Bike Barn will probably be more expensive and may take longer because they usually a backlog of repairs
                to deal with, but they are convenient if your bike is already on campus.</p>
            <p class="section-text">If the repair required is complex, then I would recommend getting a trained mechanic
                to fix your bike. However, if it is a simple problem, then I think you should try to fix your bike
                yourself.</p>
            <h3 class="section-subheader">DIY</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Simple problems like replacing a tube or chain can be done yourself. Even if you are
                not comfortable repairing a bike, there are a lot of good documents and videos online that can teach you
                how to do repairs. Buying replacement parts and doing your own repairs is a lot cheaper and will teach
                you more about bikes!</p>
