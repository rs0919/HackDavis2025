                    Davis offers great public transportation methods in the form of Unitrans and YoloBus. These buses
                    offer
                    an inexpensive way to get around the city and county. I enjoy biking, but when it's pouring or over
                    100F
                    you can find me on the bus.

                Unitrans is the bus service is managed by ASUCD, the UC Davis student body, and operated by students.
                They offer great coverage of the city and are a great way to commute to and from campus. There are bus
                terminals at both the Silo and Memorial Union on campus. The bus stops
                and schedules can be found on the <a class="info-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="https://unitrans.ucdavis.edu/">Unitrans</a>
                website.
                You can also use Google Maps to plan your route (it's usually pretty accurate). </p>
            <p class="section-text">Because Unitrans is
                funded by ASUCD, students can ride the bus for free. All you need to do is show the driver your student
                ID. If you are not a student,
                (put fares in table?) fare is currently $1.50 to ride the bus. You can also buy passes through
                the ZipPass mobile app or at the UC Davis store. Costs are $8.50 for ten rides, $34 for a month, $87 for
                the
                quarter, or $245 for the annual pass.</p>

            <p class="section-text">
                I ride Unitrans often, especially in the winter when it is too cold or wet for me to bike. Most of the
                time, service is frequent and reliable. One of the few issues I have is that bus service is pretty
                sparse on the weekends. Also, because so many people rely on Unitrans, buses can get very packed and it
                can be an uncomfortable (albiet short) bus ride. Overall, it's a great option for students.</p>

        <div class="section" id="yolo-bus">
            <h1 class="section-header">YoloBus</h1>
            <p class="section-text"><a class="info-link" href="https://yolobus.com/">YoloBus</a> is a bus service for
                all of Yolo County. It has multiple stops in Davis,
                including the Memorial Union terminal. I have used Yolo Bus to visit Downtown
                Sacramento or to go to the airport. They also service Woodland and Winters. Just like Unitrans, YoloBus
                is free with your student ID so you can
                save a lot of money by using YoloBus to go to and from the airport instead of something like Uber,
                especially since ride share services will upcharge for airport fares.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Yolo County service is not bad, but it can be a little inconsistent. There have been
                a few times where I have had to wait a lot longer than I expected for the bus to arrive. I think YoloBus
                is a good way for non-car owners to visit Sacramento.</p>

                    href="https://police.ucdavis.edu/safe-rides">Safe Ride</a> is a
                free rideshare service offered by the UC Davis Police Department for UC Davis students and employees. As
                the name implies, it is a way for you to safely get back home, even if it is night and the buses have
                stopped running or there is no bus stop near you home.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Safe Ride operates 7 days a week and can take you from campus to another on-campus
                location (5PM - 3AM) or a residential address in Davis (8PM - 3AM). To book a Safe Ride, you can either
                install the UC Davis <a class="info-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="https://police.ucdavis.edu/safe-rides#app">Safe Ride app</a> or you can call 530-754-2677.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Safe Ride is a really cool service that helps people feel safe, but it is not
                necessarily the most convenient option. Wait time can be very long, especially during busy times. I
                would try to use other transit options if they are available and you feel safe using them.</p>

            <p class="section-text">The Davis-Berkley shuttle offers a relatively inexpensive way to travel to Berkley
                and the bay area for UC Davis students and employees. Currently, the shuttle runs every day except
                Saturday and certain holidays and tickets cost $20 one way. The shuttle schedule can be found <a

                WiFi and outlets. (list times, price, pros/cons). </p>

            <p class="section-text">I have not used the shuttle, but it does seem like a pretty good way to go to the
                Bay for the weekend.</p>
